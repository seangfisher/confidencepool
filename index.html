  <br><br>
  <p1>Select the winner of each 
    game and then assign a confidence 
    number to that game, with 1 being 
    the least confident and 16 (if there 
    are no teams on bye) being the most 
    confident. If you correctly pick the 
    winner, you get the associated points, 
    otherwise you get 0 for that game.</p1>
  <br><br>
  <p1>Whoever has the highest points for 
    the week gets the pot for that week. 
    If there is a tie in the points, it 
    comes down to the tiebreaker. For the 
    tiebreaker, enter your guess at the 
    COMBINED score of the Monday night 
    game. (i.e. if you think it will be 
    13-24 you would enter 37)</p1>
  <br><br>
  <b style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">Rules</b>
  <br><br>
  <p1>$2 entry fee each week.</p1>
  <br><br>
  <p1>The Thursday night pick has to be in 
    by 7:20pm CST each Thursday. Your other 
    picks do not need to be submitted at this 
    time. You can just text/email me your 
    Thursday pick and then email me everything 
    else later.</p1>
  <br><br>
  <p1>All other picks must be submitted by 
    the first kickoff on Sunday. This will 
    typically be noon, but if there is an 
    international game, it could be earlier.</p1>
